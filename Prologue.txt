In the shadow of eons past, as ancient glaciers wept,
A somber prophecy emerged, in whispered secrets kept.
From realms unseen and stories untold,
The fate of Aesir and the world would unfold.

Heimdall's horn, its call stark and clear,
Echoed across the cosmos, drawing Ragnarok near.
Born from chaos, a titan of old,
Whose demise shaped the world, as sagas foretold.

His husk laid the lands, teeth as forests took form,
And from his wounded heart, oceans began to swarm.
Crafted by the All-Father's omnipotent hand,
Destiny weaved its threads, binding sea, sky, and land.

Once more, that omen arose, an augury of doom,
As Heimdall's horn heralded battles that'd consume.
Mighty warriors of Valhalla, in glory and despair,
Sharpened their ethereal weapons, the end they'd dare.

Under the gaze of the supreme general, fierce and profound,
Valhalla's bravest prepared, their spirits unbound.
By Odin's side, blind, yet thunder's might in hand,
Thor with Mjolnir raged, defending the last stand.

As the twilight of gods dawned, a tempest of fire and frost,
An era beckoned where Valhalla's whispers would be lost.
